# Traffic Jamn't
### project created for The Stupid Hackathon#2 Thailand 2018
The Code is only available for this stupid purpose. 
All source file created by 5 Devs of EWMPevilCORP

### For this project we use 3 Google map APIs
1. Places_autocomplete API for places data from Google
2. Geolocation API for current location and GPS usage
3. Destination API for creating the route

### How it works?
We have got the smartest algorithm:
We random new latitude and longtitude within 3 and -3 range by Math.random to generate the hidden location and we hide it with clearStupidDot() func. We have the bug sprayer func for a fallback worst case scenario.

We decided to allow you to paticipate in our project, so feel free to makes any PRs you can to clean up my messy code.
